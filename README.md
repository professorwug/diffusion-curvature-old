# Diffusion Curvature
> Algorithms for computing the pointwise curvature of graphs with diffusion.


Our main technique is known as "Diffusion Laziness Curvature": it computes a "laziness" value for each point from how often a random walk started at that point returns to its initial neighborhood. This library includes tools for assessing the best parameters for your dataset, along with many examples of diffusion curvature in use.
